Why Early Diagnosis Is Important (Shortened Version)
1. Neurodegeneration Is Irreversible

Once neurons are lost, they cannot be restored. Detecting ALS or cognitive decline early allows interventions before severe damage occurs.

2. Symptoms Appear Late

ALS and FTD-related cognitive symptoms often emerge only after major neurodegeneration, delaying treatment and reducing available options.

3. Cognitive Changes Are Often Missed

Around half of ALS patients develop cognitive or behavioural symptoms, yet these are frequently overlooked. Early diagnosis supports safer decision-making and earlier care planning.

4. Diagnosis Relies on Clinical Judgement

With no definitive biomarkers, ALS diagnosis can be slow and uncertain. Objective tools help reduce misdiagnosis, delays, and unnecessary procedures.

5. Enables Earlier Support & Intervention

Although ALS has no cure, early identification improves access to multidisciplinary care, respiratory support, and clinical trials—leading to better quality of life.

6. Helps Patients and Families Plan Ahead

Early diagnosis gives individuals more time to prepare, make informed decisions, and arrange appropriate support systems.

7. Critical for Research & Stratified Treatment

Early detection improves patient stratification for clinical trials and helps identify those likely to develop cognitive impairment—supporting more precise and targeted therapies.
